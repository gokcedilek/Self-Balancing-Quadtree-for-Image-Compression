   * The QTree represents the subimage from (0,0) to (2^k,2^k) for the
   * largest possible integer k.
   * Every node corresponds to a square of pixels in the original PNG,
   * represented by an (x,y) pair for the upper left corner of the
   * square and a size for the number of pixels on the square's side.
   *

   * on the number of leaves in the tree. As long as the number of
   * leaves in the QTree is less than the leafBound, the constructor
   * splits the leaf with the highest variance (see "split" below).
   * The four children of the original leaf become new leaves of the
   * QTree and the original leaf becomes an internal node (no longer
   * a leaf).
   *
   * If the QTree is supposed to be balanced, the creation of these
   * new leaves may force other nodes to split, which in turn may
   * force other splits...

   * and a flag that tells the constructor whether or not to produce
   * a balanced quad tree.
